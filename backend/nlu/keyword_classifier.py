"""
backend/nlu/keyword_classifier.py

Keyword-matching baseline classifier for banking intent classification.

This is the ZERO-TRAINING baseline used in the project's baseline vs
fine-tuned comparison.  It requires no model download, no GPU, and no
training data — demonstrating what is achievable with pure rule-based
matching before any machine learning is applied.

Design decisions
----------------
Keywords are hand-written domain terms, NOT derived from the training
data.  Deriving keywords automatically (e.g. most frequent words per
class in the 294 training sentences) would let the baseline implicitly
learn from training data, contaminating the comparison.  A human writing
"balance", "loan", "withdraw" with zero knowledge of specific sentences
is the methodologically honest approach — it makes the DistilBERT
improvement look earned, not inflated.

The keyword map is intentionally small and simple: 3–5 high-signal phrases
per intent.  A baroque keyword system with 50 rules per intent would
undermine the comparison story — the baseline should be "dumb" enough to
be clearly worse than a trained model on this domain.

All keywords are imported from this single file.  No intent keyword
appears in any other file in the module.

# Design notes on potential ambiguities:
# - "credit" (deposit_money): rare in deposit context but could appear in
#   interest-rate phrasing ("credit card rate"). Kept because deposit
#   phrasing ("credit my account") is common; the risk is noted.
# - "name" (account_info_query): broad term but in banking context "change
#   my name / update name" is a clear account-info request. Kept as-is.
# - "rate" (interest_rate_query): could theoretically appear in other
#   contexts but banking queries are sufficiently constrained.
# - "apply" is intentionally NOT in open_account to avoid matching
#   "apply for a loan" hitting both apply_loan and open_account.

class KeywordClassifier:
    """
    Classify a banking query into one of 7 intents using keyword matching.

    No model, no training, no network calls.  Instant inference.

    The classifier is stateless — it holds no mutable state and is safe
    to reuse across calls without re-instantiation.  The singleton cache
    in ``__init__.py`` keeps one instance for the process lifetime.

    Classification logic
    --------------------
    1. Lowercase the input text.
    2. Count how many keywords from each intent's list appear as
       substrings in the lowercased text.
    3. The intent with the **most matches** wins.
    4. Ties are broken by the order intents appear in ``INTENTS``
       (the shared ordering from intents.py) — deterministic, never random.
    5. Confidence = ``match_count / len(keyword_list_for_winner)``
       (fraction of the winner's keywords that fired).
    6. If no keyword matches at all, return ``("check_balance", 0.0)``
       as the safe fallback (AC-1.2: no crash, no None).

    Notes
    -----
    ``check_balance`` is the fallback because it is the most frequent
    banking query type and the least consequential to misclassify
    (informational, not transactional).
